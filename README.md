# MVA Project for Generative models

Code for the project based on the article Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models from [Jiaming Song](http://tsong.me), [Chenlin Meng](http://cs.stanford.edu/~chenlin) and [Stefano Ermon](http://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon), Stanford

Based on the repo:

- [https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim/](https://github.com/ermongroup/ddim/) (the original DDIM pytorch repo),
- [https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/ddim](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/ddim) (HuggingFace implementation).

Our contribution and experiments are located in the following notebooks: `experiments.ipynb` and `huggingface_expe.ipynb`.
